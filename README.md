# Video Utility in Node.js

A powerful video processing tool built with Node.js and FFmpeg to enhance your videos.

## Features

- Speed up videos by 10x
- Add background music
- Apply visual effects

## Planned Enhancements

- Variable speed adjustment (1x to 20x)
- Multiple audio track support

- Video trimming and merging
- Subtitle integration
- Output format selection (MP4, WebM, AVI)
- Command-line interface (CLI) for easy usage
- Web-based user interface for non-technical users

## Technical Considerations

- Implement modular architecture for easy feature additions
- Use streams for efficient memory usage during processing
- Implement error handling and logging for better debugging
- Add unit tests and integration tests for reliability
- Consider using worker threads for parallel processing
- Implement progress tracking and ETA for long operations

## Performance Optimization

- Implement caching for frequently used audio and effect assets
- Use hardware acceleration when available
- Optimize FFmpeg command parameters for faster processing
